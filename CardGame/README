OVERALL OBJECTIVE:
Write a program that allows the user to play the card game flip. Flip is played by one player with a standard deck of 52 cards.
The game has the following steps: 
  1) The cards are shuffled three times.
  2) The player draws 24 cards from the top of the deck, without looking at them, and places them face down on the table.
  3) The player can either select a card to turn over, or end the game. If a card is turned over, the player:
    a) receives 10 points for an ace
    b) receives 5 points for a king, queen or jack
    c) receives 0 points for an 8, 9 or 10
    d) loses half their points for a 7
    e) loses all their points for a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
    f) receives 1 point extra, in addition to the above, for a heart
  4) A player’s goal is to end the game with the most points

PART A SPECIFICATIONS:
1) Fully implement a card class that stores a single card. A card includes a value and a suit (club, diamond, heart or spade). 
  The class should at least include:
  a) a constructor
  b) setValue() and setSuit() functions 
  c) getValue() and getSuit() functions 
  d) an overloaded << operator to print a card’s value and suit.
2) Fully implement a deck class that stores the cards in a deck in order. A deck of cards should be implemented using a 
  linked list of nodes, each of which contains a single card. The deck object should contain a pointer to the 
  first card in the deck. 
  The class should at least include 
  a) a constructor that creates a deck with all the cards in order (ace-king, club-diamond-heart-spade)
  b) an overloaded << operator that prints the cards in the deck
  c) a shuffle() function that shuffles the cards in the deck (Use any algorithm to shuffle the cards that puts the cards in a
  random order).
3) Include a main function that initializes a deck and prints all the cards in the deck before shuffle and after shuffle.

I would like to thank my project partner Spandana Machavarapu for collaborating with me to comeplete this assignment.
