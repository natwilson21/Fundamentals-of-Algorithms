# Fundamentals-of-Algorithms
A collection of projects created in EECE2540 Fundamentals of Algorithms in the Fall 2023 semester. 
I would like to thank Spandana Machavarapu for collaborating on these projects with me. 
Each project has a README file that describes the objective and specifications for each program listed as well as the source code.
