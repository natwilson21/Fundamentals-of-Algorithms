OVERALL OBJECTIVE:
Write a program that solves a word search puzzle. The program reads an NxN grid of letters from a file and prints out
all of the words that can be found in the grid. Words that can be found in the array by starting from any letter and reading
left, right, up, down, or any words that wrap around the edges of the array. Words must be at least 5 characters long.
The list of k possible words is included in the file dictionary. 
The goal is to find an algorithm that solves this problem that runs as quickly as possible for large n and k. 

PART A SPECIFICATIONS:
1) Implement a class called 'dictionary' that reads the words from the dictionary file and stores them in a vector that includes:
  A) A function to read the words from the dictionary file
  B) A function to print the word vector
  C) A function that sorts the words using selectionsort
  D) A functino to handle word lookups using binary search
2) Implement a class called 'grid' that reads the letters in the grid from a file and stores them in a matrix.
3) Implement a global function called 'FindMatches()' that is passed the dictionary and the grid as parameters and
    prints out all words that can be found in the grid.

I would like to thank my project partner Spandana Machavarapu for collaborating with me to comeplete this assignment.
